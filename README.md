[rsstodolist](http://rsstodolist.appspot.com/) is an URL oriented to-read-list based on an RSS XML feed.

Typical example is putting web pages to read later on a RSS feed.

Also, if you know the feed name of a friend of yours, you may also "push" links to it's RSS feed. That's another cool use case.

This project hosts source code for application and following extensions :
  * the Google App Engine rsstodolist application written in Python (python-gae) hosted here : http://rsstodolist.appspot.com/
  * a Google Chrome extension (chrome-extension). Install it from the [Google extension site](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gjnfedompndjcoeannmcppbckbkjhpkd).
